## üí´ About Me:
A proactive, dynamic, communicative Full Stack Software Developer with a love of performing and writing music, reading, food, travel and helping others to realise their potential.

Previously in my career I was a qualified musician and teacher, subsequently moving into a further education senior manager role. I was drawn towards software development due to its potential to be applied in all manners of industry and life, offering varied and exciting opportunities.
